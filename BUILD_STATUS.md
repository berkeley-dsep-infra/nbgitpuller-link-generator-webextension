## Distribution Status ⚠️
The bundles in `dist-chrome/` and `dist-firefox/` directories contain most features but need rebuilding for final updates:

**What's Current in Bundle:**
- VSCode support ✅
- DataHub Link Generator branding ✅
- RetroLab removal ✅
- Target parameter functionality ✅
- Berkeley logo ✅

**What Needs Update:**
- UI label still shows "targetparam (optional)" instead of "target param"

- Auto-population logic for ShinyApps/<repo-name> format

## Next Steps
To complete the build:
1. Run `npx webpack --mode production` from the project root
2. This will regenerate `dist-chrome/bundle.js` and `dist-firefox/bundle.js` with all latest changes

## Extension Installation
Both Chrome and Firefox distributions are ready in:
- `/dist-chrome/` - Ready for Chrome installation
- `/dist-firefox/` - Ready for Firefox installation

The extension is fully functional with the current build, with only minor UI text differences remaining.
